I started by reading up by listening to music examples posted on the course site and one sounded particularly interesting: John Chowning â€“ Stria. The name sounded familiar and it quickly connected that the composition is by the discoverer of FM synthesis. I then read about the technical side of FM while looking at the example patch from the class and figuring out how it works. While playing with the patch I tried to quickly change parameters and see the sound reaction to the changes. It was interesting so I decided to give it some automation so multiple parameters could be changed simultaneously. After playing with those for a while I arrived at 2 sounds: paced tone of varied pitch and longer sliding sound that sounded similar to a cicada chirp. I then decided to merge two with random time switches and pitch variation to make the piece more dynamic. Some of the challenges included quickly saving the sound parameters and current dynamic automation setting when playing with the synth. Having those coupled in presets would be convenient as they can be reused in the piece.
